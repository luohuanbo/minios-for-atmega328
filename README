It's a mini real-time os for atmega328p(arduino).
The file structure:
	timer.c is used to setup timer for systick.
	usart.c is used to setup usart and printf function.
	task.c is the most important part in the project, it provids user two 
		functions, taskCreate for create a task and startTaskSchedul to 
		start the kernel.
	main.c is just a demo for user to use it. It contants two tasks that 
		printf something.
